My Dotfiles!

These files enable a colorful terminal prompt that:
  - is colorful
  - has a descriptive prompt
  - Realizes when it's in a git repository and lists the current branch and the status (if any) of all un-committed files.

##Instructions:

To use these files, do the following:

  1. Download them!
  2. Copy them into your home directory: <code>~</code>
  3. Load a new terminal session!


Notes:
  - The <b>git</b> related features can be changed in <code>.bash_prompt</code> (look for the giant tree-looking bundle of lines)
  - The <b>color</b> features are also in <code>.bash_prompt</code>
  - <b>the first 7 lines of <code>.bash_profile</code> are necessary for <code>.bash_prompt</code> to work!
